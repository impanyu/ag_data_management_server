   <p class="col-lg-12 col-12" style="font-size:1.25rem; font-weight:400"><b>Agriculture Data Management and Analytics (ADMA)</b> is a comprehensive data management platform developed for experts within and outside IANR. It is a state-of-the-art solution designed to address the multifaceted challenges faced by modern agriculture. As the world grapples with population growth, climate change, and diminishing natural resources, the need for data-driven innovation in agroecosystems has never been more critical.

ADMA is a comprehensive platform that harnesses the power of advanced technologies, such as IoT, high-resolution sensors, and cloud computing, to facilitate data collection, integration, and analysis across various agricultural disciplines. By incorporating the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), ADMA aims to break down data silos and promote collaboration among researchers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders.

Key features of the ADMA platform include:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>
   <b>Interactive Data Management and Analysis Portals</b>: Accessible through web GUI, command line, and API, these user-friendly interfaces empower users to manage, analyze, and share data with ease.
  </li>
  <li>
 <b>Scalability and Flexibility</b>: Leveraging the capabilities of High-Performance Computing (HPC), ADMA can efficiently process large volumes of heterogeneous data, while also allowing users to incorporate their own data management and analysis tools.
  </li>
  <li>
<b>Open-source Technology</b>: Built upon a robust framework of open-source technologies, ADMA fosters a collaborative environment for continuous improvement and innovation.
</li>
  <li>
   <b>Pipeline management</b>: ADMA keeps track of different operations on each file, maintains and visualize the pipeline record for each file.
  </li>
 </ul>

      <p class="col-lg-12 col-12" style="font-size:1.25rem; font-weight:400">
          Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture of the systems. There are six components: data source, batch processing, real-time processing, actuators, server and Front-end.
      </p>
<ul>
      <li>
          <b>Data source</b> is mainly composed of four parts: RDBMS, NoSQL database and file system for storing the historical data, sensors for collecting real-time data streams, metadata for storing the formats and configuration about all the data and tools.
</li>
<li>
    <b>Batch processing </b>component is the engine of the whole system, where big data processing occurs. This component runs in containerized environment. The containerized environment can host various types of containerized tools such as R, Python, Matlab, Tensorflow, Cuda, MPI and many more customized tools for the specific disciplines. There is a container scheduler such as swarm or Kubernetes to manage the running of containers. Various user defined data processing and model training can be conducted in the container environment.
</li>
      <li>
<b>Real-time processing</b> component connects to the sensors and stream the real-time data for further processing. Containerized environment is also supported, where hosted pre-trained models and customized tools can process data and make decisions in real-time or near real-time fashion. The real time data from sensors can be fed to the data processing module and the decisions and commands can be output to the actuator to execute. This component is a necessary complement to batch processing when real-time analysis and control is required and relatively low accuracy is tolerated.
      </li>
      <li>
<b>Actuator</b> is included in the system to make it more like a fully functioning control system. Connected to the real-time processing component, the actuator executes the commands/decisions output by the hosted models or user coded tools. The types of actuators vary among different disciplines. For biological system engineering, to name a few, there are actuators such as irrigation systems, robotics and field operation machines.
      </li>
      <li>
<b>Server</b> is the operational handler of the whole system. Data management module is responsible for the ordinary operation such as file search, retrieve, upload, delete, update and processing. Version control is also considered in the future implementation. Tool management module keeps the information of the tool sets used in the system. Model management module is responsible for maintaining all the pre-trained models. Data processing module talks to and manages the batch processing and real-time processing components. This module is an umbrella module for all the data processing jobs such as data pre-processing, data co-locating, batch processing, model training,  model hosting, real-time processing, etc.  Security and authentication module guarantees the data storage & transmission is secure and each user has a separate access permission and view to the data. Data service API acts as the portal for the front-end to manipulate the data in our system.
      </li>
      <li>
          <b>Front-end</b> runs on the user side machine and can take the forms of web browser, command-line or third-party software. The front end communicates with the server through the data service API. Users of our system can conduct ordinary file management operations and initiate data processing requests to the system. The analytical results can be displayed in the front end for the user to view.
      </li>
  </ul>

       <p class="col-lg-12 col-12" style="font-size:1.25rem; font-weight:400">ADMA maintains four modes, namely data, tool, model and collection.</p>
           <ul>
               <li><b>Data</b> is the most general and default mode. </li>
               <li><b>Tool</b> represents any native or user uploaded programs or scripts. Tools operate on data and can form pipelines of various forms.</li>
               <li><b>Model</b> represents the files generated from any machine learning training process. It is hybrid of data and tools. When training by some training program, it can be considered as data. When inferring, it can be considered as tool.</li>
               <li><b>Collection</b> is the set of data, tool and model. The user can create their own collection and include any of their data, tools and models within the collection.</li>

            Once "Run" button is clicked, a message will be prompted indicating the program starts running in a containerized environment(Figure 11). Then the user can check the execution status of the program by scroll to the bottom of the metadata panel, where the container id, docker image, status and running time of the running instances of the tool will be displayed (Figure 12).
              While the tool is running, there will also a "green" dot before the name of the tool in the file management system. After the program stops, the user can check the output in their specified location.

ADMA keeps track of all native operations and user submitted tools.
          For instance, in Figure 13, when user uploads a file named "21_E1801_A103_rgba_green.png", the pipeline will show it is uploaded from external resource. In Figure 14, when user create a new folder, the pipeline of it will indicate it is created from "null". Figure 15 shows the pipeline of a TIF file which is uploaded by user and then converted to PNGs for
             each of its band. Figure 16 illustrates how a user defined tool: "calculate_ndvi.py" converts two user uploaded TIF files and generates one image file: "ndvi.png".
